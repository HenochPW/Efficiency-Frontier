# Premier League Player Efficiency Scout ⚽📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Premier League player production by comparing **Total Minutes Played** against **Goals + Assists per 90 minutes**. 

The goal is to identify "hidden gems"—players with high production rates who may be undervalued due to lower total playing time—and to visualize the "Efficiency Frontier" where elite players like Mohamed Salah operate.

## Key Insights
- **Elite Tier:** Mohamed Salah remains the league's most consistent high-volume producer.
- **Hidden Gems:** Jader Durán and Alexander Isak show elite efficiency despite differing minute totals.
- **League Average:** The dotted line represents the league average for players with 500+ minutes, highlighting those performing at a "Scout-worthy" level.
